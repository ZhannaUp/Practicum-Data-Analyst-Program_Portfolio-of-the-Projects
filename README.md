This repository is dedicated to Yandex Practicum’s Data Analyst (DAYP). It contains all major projects, completed in the program. Please feel free to take a look at the program syllabus and scroll through  <a href="https://practicum.yandex.ru">official website</a> , in meanwhile, I invite you to take a look at the projects, my certificate of completion, and highlights from the program.

## Program Highlights

DAYP program equipt me well with essential knowledge of data analysis. The lessons, case studies, and projects covered all aspects of data analysis:

● Defining problem and analytical questions \
● Data wrangling (gathering, assessing, and cleaning data) \
● EDA and feature engineering \
● Testing and concluding from descriptive & inferential statistics \
● Data visualization and communication 

Additionally, I enjoyed the emphasis on Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matpolotlib, Ploty and Seaborn. I was most impressed with the statistical topics such as Binominal Distribution, Conditional Probability, Bayes Rule, Hypothesis Testing, Regression, and A/B testing. The lesson also covered VIFs (variance inflation factors), full rank models and higher-order interactions in regression models. Essential knowledge for a deep understanding of data analysis and data science! I also loved the complex approach to the bivariate and multivariate visualizations with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Projects

Please find the summaries for each of the main projects that I have completed in the (DAYP) Program in the section below. Each individual summary contains project highlights and links to the project’s repository and submission review.

### 🟣 Project 1 - <a href="https://github.com/ZhannaUp/Practicum-Data-Analyst-Program_Portfolio-of-the-Projects/tree/main/Projects/Analyze%20A_B%20Test%20Results">Analyze A/B Test Results</a>
  
  
In this project, I am performing A/B testing for the company’s new website. I performed hypothesis testing with Python and NumPy to determine p-value and used regression models to advise if the company should launch a new website. The result is robust statistical analysis and interpretation of results to ensure the right decision for the company. The highlights of this project are interpretations of p-value, z-score and critical value, use of full rank models, VIF and higher-order interactions in regression models.

### 🟣 Project 2 - <a href="https://github.com/ZhannaUp/Practicum-Data-Analyst-Program_Portfolio-of-the-Projects/tree/main/Projects/Business%20metrics%20of%20Ad%20campaigns">Business metrics of Ad campaigns</a>


### 🟣 Project 3 - <a href="https://github.com/ZhannaUp/Practicum-Data-Analyst-Program_Portfolio-of-the-Projects/tree/main/Projects/Product%20analysis">Product analysis</a>
